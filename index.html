          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named 
          Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late 
          with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
          should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
          evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a 
          prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
          uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
          ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles 
          were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a 
          double box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had 
          seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically 
          as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic 
          time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. 
          Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the 
          fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature 
          of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of 
          a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun 
          evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was 
          correct.
